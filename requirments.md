Property Transaction Streamlining Solution Using Blockchain and AI
1. Overview

This solution addresses the inefficiencies, fraud risks, and inaccessibility issues in property transactions within India by leveraging blockchain technology, AI, and fractional ownership models. The project aims to streamline property registration, ensure document authenticity, and make real estate investments accessible to small investors.

2. Problem Statement

Slow and Manual Property Registration: Property registration in India is slow, manual, and involves multiple intermediaries, resulting in delays, confusion, and errors.

High Fraud Risk: The current system is prone to document fraud (e.g., fake sale deeds, manipulated land records), causing legal disputes and financial loss.

Inaccessible Real Estate Investment: Real estate investments often require high capital, preventing small investors from purchasing premium assets like hospitals and commercial buildings.

Limited Trustworthy Investment Options: Current real estate investment opportunities lack transparency, verified ownership, and fractional investment options.

3. Solution

The solution involves creating a Blockchain-based Property Passport, an immutable, fraud-resistant record for each property, providing verified ownership history, key documents, and a transparent transaction trail. Additionally, it will offer Fractional Ownership, allowing small-ticket investments in high-value assets.

Key Features:

Verified Property Profile: Digital record of ownership, history, approvals, and legal documents.

Immutable Documentation: Tamper-proof documents via blockchain technology to ensure authenticity and detect fraud.

Guided Registration Process: Step-by-step, transparent workflow for property registration, tracking, and signing.

Fractional Ownership: Enables small investors to invest in fractions of high-value real estate assets.

4. Technologies

Blockchain: For creating an immutable ledger for property ownership and transaction history.

AI: For fraud detection (document verification, historical data analysis) and automated due diligence.

Smart Contracts: For automating the execution of property transactions and agreements.

Fractional Ownership Platform: To tokenize real estate properties, allowing users to buy a fraction of premium assets.

React.js: For the user interface of the platform.

Node.js: For backend services and handling blockchain interactions.

5. Target Audience

Property Buyers: Individuals looking to purchase verified properties with a transparent transaction history.

Investors: Small investors who wish to invest in fractions of large real estate assets like commercial buildings, hospitals, and warehouses.

Real Estate Developers: Who want to streamline the selling and documentation process of their properties.

Government Authorities: To support the implementation of blockchain-based property records.

6. User Stories

Buyer: As a buyer, I want to view a verified property profile and its history, so I can make an informed purchase decision.
